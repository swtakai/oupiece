            <p class="text1">The Oakland University and Pontiac Initiative Early Childhood Education committee is a branch of the larger Oakland University and City of Pontiac partnership formed in 2014. As part of the “Education-PK12 Connections” of the Oakland University & Pontiac Initiative, this early childhood partnership is an ongoing project.</p>
            <p class="text2">Our group operates under the mission to enhance the quality and access of early childhood services for children and families through various projects in Pontiac. In regards to our committee's work, we implement various initiatives to help children and parents. Some of our work includes the following: hosting early childhood activities to enhance play and active learning at local health fairs; organizing workshops to raise awareness of childhood trauma; assisting with literacy events to encourage early education for families; and conducting resilience screenings to promote healthy early relationships and help combat Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).</p>
            <p class="text3">Our committee hosts monthly meetings that have gathered professionals from a plethora of occupations. Members of our committee include area service providers, religious leaders, educators, government officials, community advocacy organizations, and parents. With an interdisciplinary and collaborative nature, our committee focuses on the impact of trauma on children and families, and we strive to address various barriers that prevent children and families of low-income homes from accessing services. Our aim is to help families in the City of Pontiac overcome impediments to well-being through providing culinary programs, trauma-informed trainings, information on maternal health and infant care, and good quality childhood education.</p>
